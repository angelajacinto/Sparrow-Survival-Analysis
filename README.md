# Sparrow-Survival-Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of sparrow survival based on morphological measurements. Utilizing logistic regression, the project aims to understand how various physical traits impact the survival rates of sparrows. Key morphological traits studied include total length, weight, humerus, and sternum sizes, among others.

## Data Source
The analysis is conducted on the historical Bumpus dataset, which provides detailed measurements of sparrows. 

## Libraries and Methods Used
- **R Language**: Primary programming language for the analysis.
- **R Libraries**: Essential libraries like `tidyverse` for data manipulation, `ggplot2` for visualization, and `caret` for model training.
- **Data Analysis**: Techniques encompass data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and logistic regression modeling.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes various plots and charts to illustrate findings and trends.
